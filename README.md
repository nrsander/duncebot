# Time to upgrade your crypto trading 🤔

My name is Herve Fulchiron, I’m a passionate full stack JS engineer and a cryptocurrency enthusiast/trader. I mostly use <a href="https://www.binance.com/?ref=10177791" target="_blank">Binance</a> for my cryptocurrency trading. Like most of the people I used to trade manually via the Binance website. I was slow to execute and beating the market gets more difficult every days.  It was time to upgrade my trading execution. Console apps run on the Terminal (or Command Prompt), and they provide an easy and efficient way to execute difficult tasks like **low latency cryptocurrency trading**. The minimalism of the graphical interface give them an edge on the speed of execution vs. manual retail trading.

Here is the article that comes with this repository: <a href="https://jsapp.me/how-to-build-an-efficient-trading-bot-for-binance-using-node-js-43d5fd174f8b" target="_blank">How to build an efficient trading bot for Binance using Node.js</a>

# What is Node-Binance-Trader? 📡

Today NBT is a trading bot console app that will:

* ask which currency you want to use to buy the wanted currency
* ask for the budget for the trade
* ask which currency you want to buy
* ask for buying method: market price, bid price or fixed buy price
* ask for selling method: trailing stop loss or maximum loss n profit percentages.
* automatically auto trade the whole operation as fast and efficient as possible.
